\section{How will the projects be scored?}

The jury scores the submitted projects on the basis of a list of criteria. Your project should get high scores in one or more of the criteria to get a high ranking. Thus you may consider the following points when writing your submission:

\begin{itemize}
    \item does the project include a novel application of the BCI?
    \item is there any new methodological approach used compared to earlier projects?
    \item is there any new benefit for potential users of a BCI?
    is there any improvement in terms of speed of the system (e.g. bit/min)?
    \item is there any improvement in terms of accuracy of the system?
    \item does the project include any results obtained from real patients or other potential users?
    \item is the used approach working online/in real-time?
    \item is there any improvement in terms of usability?
    \item does the project include any novel hardware or software developments?
\end{itemize}
