    abstract = {{We present an open-source Python library, called Explauto, providing a unified API to design and compare various exploration strategies driving various sensorimotor learning algorithms in various simulated or robotics systems. Explauto aims at being collaborative and pedagogic, providing a platform to developmental roboticists where they can publish and compare their algorithmic contributions related to autonomous exploration and learning, as well as a platform for teaching and scientific diffusion. The library is available at this address: https://github.com/flowersteam/explauto}},
