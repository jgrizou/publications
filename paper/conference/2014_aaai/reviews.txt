----------- QUALITY JUSTIFICATION -----------
The authors use a lot of terminology without providing precise
definitions.  A few examples are below:

"hallucinate different virtual labels"  what does this mean?

"... it is possible to build the underlying distributions for each
possible target."  unclear

Figure 1: if this is a 1-D action space, what is the 2-dimensional
space being shown in the bottom part of the figure?

Simultaneous estimation of task and signal model section: a lot of
different pieces are presented.  However, it is not very clear how
they fit together.

"U(s,a)" is used on page 4 without being defined.

"during stage 1": it is not clear what this refers to.

------------------------------

The authors spend text talking about their use of RL to generate
action sequences to a hypothesized goal.  But, with such simple
environments, many different planners would do.

----------- NOVELTY/INNOVATION JUSTIFICATION -----------
The problem of implementing BCIs without explicit calibration is
important and difficult.  The general approach to solving this form of
BCI problem may be on the right track.

----------- IMPACT JUSTIFICATION -----------
Solving this problem could be a key step in deploying BCIs to the real
world.

----------- SUMMARY OF REVIEW FOR AUTHORS -----------
The authors propose an approach to the problem of interpreting EEG
signals for control without explicit calibration.  An intervening
agent uses a guess about the current (unknown) goal of the user to
produce actions in a primitive action space.  Based on BCI-received
feedback of whether the primitive actions are correct, the agent
may modify its estimate of the goal.  Once the goal is reached, the
feedback decoder is updated to be more consistent with the putative
feedback from the user.  

This is an important problem to be solved in the area of brain-machine
interfaces (and a difficult one).  It may very well be the case that
the authors are making good progress on this problem.  However, the
paper is written in a vague enough way that it is hard to assess the
true details of the approach and the experimental results (some
details above).  

Experiments: does the learning system know when the goal is reached?
What does "probability of target task" mean, specifically in figure 2?

Experiment 1: What does it mean that the target task is chosen
randomly?  Does the experiment control system decide this or is the
task self-selected by the user?  The authors don't compare their
approach to any others (including a baseline approach).  What if the
agent were to simply perform a random walk - would figure 2 look the
same?

Experiment 2: the conditions of the experiment & its evaluation are
unclear.

In general, no statistical analyses are performed to support the
experimental results.

----------- QUALITY JUSTIFICATION -----------
The technical and presentation quality of this paper is adequately positive.

----------- NOVELTY/INNOVATION JUSTIFICATION -----------
This paper contributes a methodology for solving sequential tasks without any calibration. While I understand the importance of this problem, it's not completely novel.

----------- IMPACT JUSTIFICATION -----------
This paper makes a small, yet important contribution.

----------- SUMMARY OF REVIEW FOR AUTHORS -----------
The paper is well written and well justified. It makes an important contribution to BCI, yet the contribution to the AI community is not quite as clear.

----------- QUALITY JUSTIFICATION -----------
* Please consider mentioning the character of your study (online and offline) in the abstract.
* Why did you make use of two channels only  (p4, right col)? SNR can significantly be reduced by exploiting ERPs from more channels...
* The term "hallucinate" does not seem appropriate.
* p1: "However, the approach needed for a ..." please re-formulate, e.g. "required"
* It is all about collecting evidence over time - compared to the approach of Kindermans et al (who, by the way, has presented results from a first online study already, see below), you seem to trade in "multiple repetitions of the same action" (p1, right col) for something like "multiple decision steps to reach the one (true) goal". Maybe good to clarify this early on.

----------- NOVELTY/INNOVATION JUSTIFICATION -----------
The completely unsupervised planning and training of an ErrP-based system is absolutely novel. The proposed metric of using "signal uncertainty" several steps ahead may be new, surely it is for this type of application. The community clearly needs to learn about this approach.
The used experimental paradigm is rather simple, but suitable to to demonstrate the basic feasibility of the approach.

----------- IMPACT JUSTIFICATION -----------
For well-structured environments, the proposed ErrP-based exploration appraoch defines a novel direction of human-robot interaction. Thus the manuscript clearly helps to bridge the gap between BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) and the robotics community.

----------- SUMMARY OF REVIEW FOR AUTHORS -----------
A novel and clearly interesting approach to label-free training of human-robot interaction.
