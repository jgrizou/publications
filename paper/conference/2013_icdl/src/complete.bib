	The interplayof hand-eye coordination in dynamic grasping tasks such
	as grasping ofparts on a moving conveyor system, assembly of articulated
	parts, or forgrasping from a mobile robotic system is explored. The
	goal is to buildan integrated sensing and actuation system that can
	operate in dynamicas opposed to static environments. The system built
	addresses three distinctproblems in using robotic hand-eye coordination
	for grasping moving objects:fast computation of 3-D motion parameters
	from vision, predictive controlof a moving robotic arm to track a
	moving object, and interception andgrasping. The system operates
	at approximately human arm movement rates.Experimental results in
	which a moving model train is tracked, stably grasped,and picked
	up by the system are presented. The algorithms developed torelate
	sensing to actuation are quite general and applicable to a varietyof
	complex robotic tasks },

	potential teammates on a set of collaborative tasks. Previous research
	has investigated theoretically optimal ad hoc teamwork strategies
	in restrictive settings. This paper presents the first empirical
	study of ad hoc teamwork in a more open, complex teamwork domain.
	Specifically, we evaluate a range of effective algorithms for on-line
	behavior generation on the part of a single ad hoc team agent that
	must collaborate with a range of possible teammates in the pursuit
	domain. },

	making skills of a robot. To enable flexible coordination and turn-taking
	between human users and a robot in joint tasks, the robot's dialog
	and decision making mechanism have to be synchronized in a meaningful
	way. In this paper, we propose a integration framework to combine
	the dialog and the decision making processes. With this framework,
	we investigate various task negotiation situations for a social robot
	in a fetch-and-carry scenario. For the technical realization of the
	framework, the interface specification between the dialog and the
	decision making systems is also presented. Further, we discuss several
	challenging issues identified in our integration effort that should
	be adddressed in the future.},

  abstract = {Picking up an object requires two basic motor operations: reaching
	and grasping.Neurophysiological studies in monkeys have suggested
	that the visuomotortransformations necessary for these two operations
	are carried out by separateparietofrontal circuits and that, for
	grasping, a key role is played bya specific sector of the ventral
	premotor cortex: area F5. The aim of thepresent study was to test
	the validity of this hypothesis by reversiblyinactivating area F5
	in monkeys trained to grasp objects of different shape,size and orientation.
	In separate sessions, the hand field of the primarymotor cortex (area
	F1 or area 4) was also reversibly inactivated. The resultsshowed
	that after inactivation of area F5 buried in the bank of the arcuatesulcus
	(the F5 sector where visuomotor neurones responding to object presentationare
	located), the hand shaping preceding grasping was markedly impairedand
	the hand posture was not appropriate for the object size and shape.The
	monkeys were eventually able to grasp the objects, but only after
	aseries of corrections made under tactile control. With small inactivationsthe
	deficits concerned the contralesional hand, with larger inactivationsthe
	ipsilateral hand as well. In addition, there were signs of peripersonalneglect
	in the hemispace contralateral to the inactivation site. Followinginactivation
	of area F5 lying on the cortical convexity (the F5 sectorwhere visuomotor
	neurones responding to action observation, 'mirror neurones',are
	found) only a motor slowing was observed, the hand shaping being
	preserved.The inactivation of the hand field of area F1 produced
	a severe paralysisof contralateral finger movements with hypotonia.
	The results of this studyindicate the crucial role of the ventral
	premotor cortex in visuomotortransformations for grasping movements.
	More generally, they provide strongsupport for the notion that distal
	and proximal movement organization reliesupon distinct cortical circuits.
	Clinical data on distal movement deficitsin humans are re-examined
	in the light of the present findings.}

	by reviewingthe prerequisite topics from robotics and computer vision,
	including abrief review of coordinate transformations, velocity representation,
	anda description of the geometric aspects of the image formation
	process.We then present a taxonomy of visual servo control systems.
	The two majorclasses of systems, position-based and image-based systems,
	are then discussedin detail. Since any visual servo system must be
	capable of tracking imagefeatures in a sequence of images, we also
	include an overview of feature-basedand correlation-based methods
	for tracking. We conclude the tutorial witha number of observations
	on the current directions of the research fieldof visual servo control.}

	recognition cues including the presenceof a face and the ability
	to interact contingently with other agents. Thecurrent studies extend
	these findings with data based on infant imitationand the production
	of communicative gestures. The first study replicatedMeltzoff's [Dev.
	Psychol. 31 (1995) 838.] reenactment of goals paradigmwith a novel,
	nonhuman agent. Fifteen-month-olds were found to reenactboth the
	completed and uncompleted/unseen goals of a novel object thathad
	a face and interacted contingently with the experimenter and infant.Concurrently,
	infants directed many communicative gestures at the object.A second
	study excluded the possibility that the communicative gesturesapparently
	directed at the object in Study 1 were in fact imitations ofthe experimenter's
	own behavior. The suggestion that novel, nonhuman objectsare capable
	of eliciting such divergent behaviors as gaze-following, goalreenactment,
	and communicative gestures from infants, supports the claimthat all
	of these behaviors are mediated by a central conceptual notionof
	mentalistic being, at least by the ages studied, and that that conceptis
	not isomorphic with the concept person.}

	angles of 2.5, 5, 7, 14,21, 28, and 35 degrees. The object oscillated
	sinusoidally along a horizontalpath with a frequency of 0.25 Hz and
	an amplitude of +/-25 degrees visualangle. It was found that the
	number of saccades was dependent on objectsize: at 6 and 9 weeks
	of age there were more saccades for the smallestobjects. With increasing
	age, the number of saccades decreased. The compositeeye movement
	gain (smooth tracking + saccades) did not change with agebut for
	the 6.5-week group the gain was higher for smaller objects. Thegain
	of the smooth eye tracking increased with age and showed no dependencyon
	object size. In conclusion, the results do not support the concept
	oftwo separate systems, the OKR and the SP, each of them processing
	eye trackingof small and large objects. Finally, it was observed
	that two infants at6.5 weeks of age who used considerable head movements
	did not inhibit thevestibular-ocular response. }

  abstract = {Action selection is a fundamental decision process for us, and depends
	on the state of both our body and the environment. Because signals
	in our sensory and motor systems are corrupted by variability or
	noise, the nervous system needs to estimate these states. To select
	an optimal action these state estimates need to be combined with
	knowledge of the potential costs or rewards of different action outcomes.
	We review recent studies that have investigated the mechanisms used
	by the nervous system to solve such estimation and decision problems,
	which show that human behaviour is close to that predicted by Bayesian
	Decision Theory. This theory defines optimal behaviour in a world
	characterized by uncertainty, and provides a coherent way of describing
	sensorimotor processes.},

	childrencould infer the adult's intended act by watching the failed
	attempts. Experiment2 tested children's understanding of an inanimate
	object that traced thesame movements as the person had followed.
	Children showed a completelydifferent reaction to the mechanical

	this case. Eighteen-month-olds situate peoplewithin a psychological

	and a deeper level involving goals and intentions. Theyhave already

  abstract = {Abstract.Pose estimation of 3-D objects based on monocu- lar computer
	visionis an ill-posed problem.To ease matters a model-based approach
	can be applied.Suchan approach usually relies on iterating when matching
	the model and theimage data.In this paper we estimate the 3-D pose
	of a human arm from amonocular image.To avoid the inherent problems
	when iterating,we applyan exhaustive matching strategy.To make this
	plausible,we reduce the sizeof the solution space through a very
	compact model representation of thearm and prune the solution space.The
	model is developed through a detailedinvestigation of the functionality
	and structure of the arm and the shouldercomplex.The model consists
	of just two parameters and is based on the screw-axisrepresentation
	together with image measurements.The pruning is achievedthrough kinematic
	constraints and it turns out that the solution spaceof the compact
	model can be pruned 97%,on average. Altogether,the compactrepresentation
	and the constraints re- duce the solution space signi .cantlyand,therefore,allow
	for an exhaustive matching procedure.The approach istested in a model-based
	silhouette framework,and tests show promising results.}

	unveil itsunderlying neural principles. We ground the functional
	architecture andinformation flow of our model in brain imaging studies
	and use findingsfrom monkey brain neurophysiological studies to drive
	the choice of implementationof our processing modules. Our neural
	model of visuo-motor imitation isbased on self-organizing maps with
	associated activities. Patterns of impairmentof the model, realized
	by adding uncertainty in the transfer of informationbetween the networks,
	account for the scores found in a clinical examinationof imitation

	In this paper, we investigatehow principles from psychology can be
	the result of neural computationsand therefore attempt to bridge
	the gap between monkey neurophysiologyand human behavioral data,
	and hence between these two complementary disciplines.Specifically,
	we address the principle of ideomotor compatibility, by which{\^a}€˜observing
	the movements of others influences the quality of one{\^a}€™sown
	performance{\^a}€™ and develop two neural models which account for
	a setof related behavioral studies [Brass, M., Bekkering, H., Wohlschla{\^A}¨ger,A.,
	& Prinz, W. (2000). Compatibility between observed and executed fingermovements:
	comparing symbolic, spatial and imitative cues. Brain and Cognition44,
	124{\^a}€“143]. We show that the ideomotor effect could be the result
	oftwo distinct cognitive pathways, which can be modeled by means
	of biologicallyplausible neural architectures. Furthermore, we propose
	a novel behavioralexperiment to confirm or refute either of the two
	model pathways.}

	When imagining hand movements, CW executed the imagined motor act
	but was unaware of the movements. These movements were significantly
	more accurate than volitional movements for the left but not right
	hand. CW also exhibited preserved motor imagery for the left but
	not right hand. Consistent with previous accounts, these findings
	suggest that motor imagery may normally involve the inhibition of
	movements. CW's unawareness of movements during motor imagery may
	reflect inattention or misattribution of the unexpected sensory feedback.
	Furthermore, in line with current models of motor control, motor
	imagery may depend on the integrity of a "forward model" derived
	from motor outflow information to generate a prediction of the consequences
	of a motor command. Such predictions appear to be preserved for imagery
	of left but not right hand movements in CW. Action may additionally
	depend on precise updating of effector position derived from the
	comparison of predicted and actual sensory information. We propose
	that CW's impaired volitional movements may be attributable to the
	degradation of such an updating mechanism.},

	Here, patients with lesionsrestricted to the parietal cortex were
	found to be impaired selectivelyat predicting, through mental imagery,
	the time necessary to perform differentiatedfinger movements and

  abstract = {Elderly and disabled people can experience considerable difficulties
	when driving a powered wheelchair, especially if they do not possess
	the fine steering capacities that are required to perform certain
	manoeuvres, like avoiding obstacles or docking at tables. In order
	to help these people, several \"intelligent\" wheelchairs have been
	developed in the past, meaning that a powered wheelchair was endowed
	with the abilities to provide navigational assistance to its user.
	In such a scenario, control over the wheelchair is shared between
	the user and the intelligent assistance. The problem of the existing
	intelligent wheelchairs is, however, that the rules for assistance
	are hard-coded and by consequence not adaptable to the personal handicap
	and needs of a specific user. Therefore, this paper proposes a new,
	more user-centered approach to shared wheelchair control. The presented
	framework executes two tasks: it continuously estimates the user's
	intention and it determines whether the user needs assistance to
	achieve that intention. An implicit user model is introduced and
	incorporated in the framework, in order to make the execution of
	both tasks adaptable to a specific user. This paper presents the
	proposed framework, along with experimental results in simulation
	and on a real wheelchair.},

	1 showed that when 2- and 3-year-oldchildren (N = 68) were shown
	a correct solution to a tool-using task (whichthey could not solve
	spontaneously), all the children in both age groupsmanaged at least
	a partial solution. When children were shown an incorrectsolution
	followed by a correct solution, 2-year-olds again produced onlya
	partial solution. By contrast, most 3-year-olds produced a full solution.Study
	2 replicated this age change in a separate sample of children (N=
	100) with a different tool-using task. Study 2 also showed that 3-year-oldsbenefit
	from observing an incorrect action when it can be contrasted witha
	correct action: they chose the more effective of the two actions.
	Takentogether, the two studies indicate that by 3 years of age, children
	donot indiscriminately imitate actions on a tool, but selectively
	reproducethose actions that have a desired causal effect.}

	to retrieve toys while a force resisting the pulling action wasapplied

	The force resisting the pull was doubled after the first 4 initialtrials
	and returned again to its original value after another 4 trials.Electromyographic
	activity from the gastrocnemius and biceps brachii muscleswas recorded.
	The proportion of pulls involving anticipatory activity inthe gastrocnemius
	muscles progressively increased between 10 and 17 months.In addition,

  abstract = {The support vector machine (SVM) is known for its good performance
	in binary classification, but its extension to multi-class classification
	is still an on-going research issue. In this paper, we propose a
	new approach for classification, called the import vector machine
	(IVM), which is built on kernel logistic regression (KLR).We show
	that the IVM not only performs as well as the SVM in binary classification,
	but also can naturally be generalized to the multi-class case. Furthermore,
	the IVM provides an estimate of the underlying probability. Similar
	to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“support pointsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the SVM, the IVM model uses
	only a fraction of the training data to index kernel basis functions,
	typically a much smaller fraction than the SVM. This gives the IVM
	a computational advantage over the SVM, especially when the size
	of the training data set is large.}
