HRI Pioneers Workshop, 2014

***Abstract:*** This paper describes a preliminary approach allowing a robot to be instructed a new unknown task by a human using communicative signals initially totally unknown to the robot. In other words, we address the problem of removing the need for calibration. We provide an intuition on how the algorithm works and report preliminary results.
